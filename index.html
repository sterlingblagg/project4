					<p> Greetings, DVC! I am here to enlighten you on a topic that this school happens to deconstruct with its iron fist! DVC limits our long-distance communication while on their campus within popular chat services! They limit a useful skill that will allow us to conduct propositions and have an expanded social life to prepare us for adulthood! As you can tell, I am an avid believer in the freedom of long-distance communication.</p>
				</div>
					<div class="righttext">
						<p> (continued from the left sidebar). I cannot stand the misconceptions and tyranny of blocking these forms of communications, which is why I will show you the truth behind long-distance communication, and why you should join our cause and fight for us to the march of freedom! (Side note: We are not responsible for anything that can, will, or may happen to you during protests, revolts, and marches).</p>
